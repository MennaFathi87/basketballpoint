# 🏀 Flutter Basketball Points Counter App

A simple Flutter app that allows users to keep track of points for two basketball teams: Team A and Team B.

## 📱 About the Project

This is my learning project built using **Flutter** where I practiced the following:

- Creating **stateful widgets**.
- Managing application **state** using `setState()`.
- Designing responsive **UI layouts** with `Column`, `Row`, `Spacer`, and `SizedBox`.
- Using **ElevatedButton** for user interaction.
- Displaying a **vertical divider** between two columns.
- Disabling the **debug banner** in the app.
- Creating clean and readable Dart code.

### ✅ Flutter Widgets:
- `StatefulWidget` and how to override `createState()`.
- `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Column`, `Row`, `Spacer`, `SizedBox`, `Text`, `VerticalDivider`.
- Styling widgets using `TextStyle` and `ElevatedButton.styleFrom`.

### ✅ State Management:
- Using `setState()` to update the score when buttons are pressed.
- Separating logic and UI in a clean way.

### ✅ Layout & UI:
- Using `Row` with `mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly` for even spacing.
- Using `VerticalDivider` to separate team sections visually.
- Responsive design with `SizedBox` and `Spacer` for consistent spacing.
